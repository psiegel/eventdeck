At the start of each turn roll 1D6 for each webbed Warrior and add his Strength.  If the total is 7 or more, he frees himself and may act normally.</text></special>

Draw a Warrior counter and place as many Snotlings as you can around that Warrior.  Repeat until all the Snotlings have been placed.
For each Snotling above one in combat with a Warrior, add +1 to their hit roll and increase their Strength by +1: e.g., 4 Snotlings make a single Strength 4 attack with +3 on the to hit roll.
Snotlings do not switch attacks unless their target dies, and will fight until killed.</text></special>
